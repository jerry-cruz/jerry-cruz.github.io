The [Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) is a famous probability problem that a lot of people (including [Paul ErdÅ‘s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s) ) seem to get wrong. It goes by other names like the three prisoners problem, and has been the source of some controversy; see the wikipedia link above for some history.

In this post, I will solve the problem using a Bayesian approach. I believe doing so will give insight into why many people seem to get it wrong.

# Problem Statement
In some solutions I've seen, the solution highly depends on stating the problem exactly right. This problem, however, is a real-world problem so I will state it was a real-world scenario. A rigorous Bayasian approach will allow us to properly handle any uncertainty. We can later discuss any changes to the solution when particular uncertainties are resolved. Here it is:

> You are on a game show with Monty Hall (the host). You are on the final round of some game. There are 3 closed doors; Monty tells you that two of them have goats behind them and one of them has a car behind it. You don't know which doors hide the goats and which one hides the car. He then tells you that you can pick a door and if you pick the door with the car you can keep the car. Figuring that you don't have any further information regarding what the doors hide, you choose a door at random. Instead of revealing the object behind the door you chose, Monty reveals a goat behind one of the other doors that you didn't choose. He then tells you that you can switch your choice to the other closed door or keep your original choice. What should you do?
