I first became aware of this problem through the article in this tweet (it came up on my google newsfeed):
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ðŸ˜‚&quot;That damn pink triangle&quot; <a href="https://t.co/0HIQDqo3tB">https://t.co/0HIQDqo3tB</a></p>&mdash; Ed Southall (@solvemymaths) <a href="https://twitter.com/solvemymaths/status/990201229094645760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 28, 2018</a></blockquote>

It didn't seem that hard despite "Stumping the Internet" so I decided to try to solve it from first principles. I came up with a solution using the fractal nature of the problem. I thought it was interesting so I wrote it up. Here it is.

# Problem Statement
Find the proportion of area that is shaded in the figure:

\begin{align}
\frac{x^2}{2} = \int_0^{x} t dt
\end{align}
